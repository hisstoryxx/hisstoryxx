- 🤔 Currently, I’m looking for a job as a Frontend(junior) developer
- I studied bio-signal processing and software validation in my master's course at graduate school. In the first year of my graduate school master's course, I accidentally started a business, I developed a mobile app and website for the first time in 5 months, and became very interested in not only Frontend But also SERVER DEVELOPMENT.
